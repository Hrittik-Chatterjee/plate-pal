# PlatePal

PlatePal is a web application that allows users to discover, create, and share recipes. Built with React, MongoDB, and Express.js, PlatePal provides a platform for exploring a wide variety of recipes, creating new recipes, and engaging with a community of food enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Recipe Discovery**: Explore a vast collection of recipes across different categories.
- **Recipe Creation**: Create and publish your own recipes with detailed ingredients, instructions, and images.
- **Rating System**: Rate recipes and provide feedback to contribute to the community's recipe quality.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication using Firebase Authentication and JWT tokens.
- **Responsive UI**: Utilizes Tailwind CSS with Daisy UI components for a clean and responsive user interface.
- **Charts and Visuals**: Display recipe analytics using Recharts for data visualization.
- **Carousel and Sliders**: Showcase recipes dynamically using Swiper and React Responsive Carousel.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM**: Declarative routing for React applications.
- **Tailwind CSS with Daisy UI**: Utility-first CSS framework with additional UI components.
- **React Icons, React Rating, React Spinners, React Tabs, React Toastify**: Enhance UI with icons, ratings, spinners, tabs, and toast notifications.
- **Recharts**: Charting library for displaying recipe analytics.
- **Swiper, React Responsive Carousel**: Libraries for creating carousels and sliders.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing recipe data.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure authentication methods including JWT tokens.

## JWT Token Authentication

PlatePal uses JWT tokens for secure user authentication. JWT tokens are generated upon successful user login and are included in subsequent requests to authenticate API calls. Hereâ€™s how JWT token authentication works in PlatePal:

1. **User Login**: When a user successfully logs in with valid credentials, the server generates a JWT token containing the user's information and a secret key.
2. **Token Storage**: The JWT token is stored in the client-side localStorage to persist the user's authentication state across browser sessions.

3. **Token Expiration**: JWT tokens have an expiration time (defined by the server) to ensure security. After expiration, the user must re-authenticate to obtain a new token.

4. **Authorization**: Each request to the backend API includes the JWT token in the Authorization header (`Bearer token`) to authenticate the user and authorize access to protected resources (like creating or editing recipes).

5. **Logout**: When the user logs out, the JWT token stored on the client-side is invalidated or deleted, ensuring that subsequent requests are not authenticated.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine.
- MongoDB installed locally or using a cloud service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas).
- Firebase project set up for authentication (optional for local development).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Hrittik-Chatterjee/plate-pal.git
   cd platepal
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`.
   - Configure variables for MongoDB connection URI, Firebase credentials (if applicable), and other settings.

4. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```
